Compare Linker
==============

Create GitHub's compare view URLs for pull request from diff of `Gemfile.lock` (and post comment to pull request).

[GitHub Compare View](https://github.com/blog/612-introducing-github-compare-view) rocks.But [diff of Gemfile.lock]() sucks. So I made Compare Linker.

Rack app for listening GitHub Webhook
-------------------------------------

There's rack application for Compare Linker with GitHub's Webhook.
